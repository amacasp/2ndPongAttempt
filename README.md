# 2ndPongAttempt
This is my 2nd attempt at Pong based off of the simple 2D game tutorial on the godot step by step. I got it to work! This version is much cleaner but a lot of the code and all of the assets were copied from the tutorial, my coding skills are just quite not there yet to make something completely original. This is still WIP and I plan to add better ball collision mechanics and a game over menu.
